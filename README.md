# Gas-Pump-Simulation
Description: This program is a simulation of a gas pump. Manipulating floating point variables to calculate things like price/gal, total cost etc. 
Input: The user will first be prompted to input a char representing their payment type "d" "c" or "q"(q = quit, ends the simulation) then they will enter their gas type "r" "p" or "s" from there they will enter a floating point number of gallons (or whole number)
Output: The program outputs multiple strings for prompts, such as asking to select payment type or gas type. I also output a "receipt" to show all the calculations from the current transaction, in this receipt I output floating point numbers as well as integers combine with string (".") to make the total look like a floating point. I also output a message when the the program ends.
